 ### Dark Mode
  To enable dark mode, keep your body element with the data attribute `data-bs-theme="dark"`.

For example, use the following HTML to have a dark layout:


<html data-bs-theme="dark">
  
### RTL Mode
To have RTL mode enabled, replace the reference of bootstrap.rtl.min.css and in the <html lang="en" dir="rtl">. Because it will set to default the light LTR version.
